# Part 5: Error Handling and Security Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive error handling and security strategy implemented across all components of the AI Chatbot system to ensure robustness against invalid or malicious inputs.

## Test Coverage Summary

### Case 1: Missing Parameters (6 Test Cases)
- **Calculator queries**: Tests missing numbers, operations, and incomplete expressions
- **Outlet queries**: Tests missing locations, outlet names, and incomplete requests
- **Product queries**: Tests empty queries, vague requests, and single words
- **Text2SQL queries**: Tests empty queries and very short inputs
- **RAG queries**: Tests empty queries and single characters

### Case 2: API Downtime (6 Test Cases)
- **Calculator API**: HTTP 500 errors, connection failures, timeouts
- **OpenAI API**: Quota exceeded, service unavailable
- **Vector Store**: Search failures, embedding errors
- **Database**: Connection issues, query failures

### Case 3: Malicious Payloads (5 Test Cases)
- **SQL Injection**: 8 different injection patterns tested
- **XSS Attempts**: Script injection, HTML injection
- **Command Injection**: Shell command attempts
- **Path Traversal**: Directory traversal attempts
- **Buffer Overflow**: Large payload attacks
- **Unicode Attacks**: Special character attacks

### Case 4: Edge Cases (3 Test Cases)
- **Calculator**: Division by zero, large numbers, negative numbers
- **Outlet Queries**: Non-existent locations, very long inputs
- **Product Queries**: Non-existent products, very specific queries

### Case 5: Recovery and Graceful Degradation (3 Test Cases)
- **Error Recovery**: System recovery after errors
- **Calculator Downtime**: Graceful degradation when calculator is unavailable
- **RAG Downtime**: Graceful degradation when RAG system is down

### Case 6: Input Validation (3 Test Cases)
- **Chatbot**: Various input types (None, empty, numbers, objects)
- **Text2SQL**: Input validation for database queries
- **RAG**: Input validation for product searches

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. Defensive Programming
- **Try-catch blocks** around all external API calls
- **Input validation** at every entry point
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **Default responses** for unexpected scenarios

### 2. User-Friendly Error Messages
- **Clear explanations** of what went wrong
- **Recovery suggestions** when possible
- **No technical jargon** in user-facing messages
- **Consistent error tone** across all components

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
- **Error logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Performance tracking** for slow operations
- **Security event logging** for malicious attempts
- **User interaction logging** for analytics

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Service health checks** before making requests
- **Timeout handling** for slow responses
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Fallback mechanisms** when services fail

## Security Strategy

### 1. Input Sanitization
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS prevention** through output encoding
- **Command injection prevention** through input validation
- **Path traversal prevention** through path validation

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **User session management** to track usage
- **Request throttling** for expensive operations
- **DDoS protection** through request filtering

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **API key validation** for external services
- **User session validation** for chat interactions
- **Role-based access control** for admin functions
- **Token-based authentication** for secure operations

### 4. Data Protection
- **Sensitive data encryption** in transit and at rest
- **PII handling** according to privacy regulations
- **Secure communication** using HTTPS/TLS
- **Data retention policies** for user information

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Chatbot Agent
```python
def respond(self, query: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Input validation
        if not query or not query.strip():
            return "I didn't catch that. Could you please repeat?"
        
        # Intent detection with error handling
        intent = self.detect_intent(query)
        
        # Tool selection with fallbacks
        if intent == "calculation":
            return self.handle_calculation(query)
        elif intent == "product_search":
            return self.handle_product_search(query)
        elif intent == "outlet_inquiry":
            return self.handle_outlet_inquiry(query)
        else:
            return self.handle_general_query(query)
            
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error for debugging
        logger.error(f"Error in chatbot response: {str(e)}")
        return "I'm having trouble understanding. Could you try rephrasing?"
```

### Calculator Tool Integration
```python
def handle_calculation(self, query: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Extract numbers and operation
        numbers = self.extract_numbers(query)
        operation = self.extract_operation(query)
        
        if len(numbers) < 2:
            return "I need two numbers to calculate. Try something like 'What is 4 plus 5?'"
        
        # Call calculator API with timeout
        response = httpx.get(
            "http://127.0.0.1:8000/calc",
            params={"a": numbers[0], "b": numbers[1], "op": operation},
            timeout=3.0
        )
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return f"The answer is {response.json()['result']}."
        else:
            return f"Sorry, I couldn't calculate that: {response.json().get('detail', 'Something went wrong.')}"
            
    except httpx.RequestError:
        return "Sorry, the calculator service is currently unavailable."
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        return "The calculation is taking too long. Please try again."
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Calculation error: {str(e)}")
        return "Something went wrong during calculation."
```

### RAG System Error Handling
```python
def query_products(self, query: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Input validation
        if not query or not query.strip():
            return "Sorry, I couldn't find anything relevant."
        
        # Vector search with error handling
        results = self.vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=2)
        
        if not results:
            return "Sorry, I couldn't find anything relevant."
        
        # Generate AI summary with fallback
        try:
            summary = self.generate_summary(query, results)
            return summary
        except Exception as e:
            # Fallback to raw results if AI summary fails
            logger.warning(f"AI summary failed, using raw results: {str(e)}")
            return "Here's what I found:\n\n" + "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in results])
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"RAG query error: {str(e)}")
        return "I'm having trouble searching for products right now. Please try again later."
```

### Text2SQL Security
```python
def query_outlets(self, query: str) -> list:
    try:
        # Input sanitization
        sanitized_query = self.sanitize_input(query)
        
        # Convert to SQL with validation
        sql_query = self.convert_to_sql(sanitized_query)
        
        # Validate SQL query structure
        if not self.is_safe_query(sql_query):
            logger.warning(f"Potentially unsafe query detected: {sql_query}")
            return []
        
        # Execute query with parameterized inputs
        results = self.database.execute_safe_query(sql_query)
        return results
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Text2SQL error: {str(e)}")
        return []  # Return empty list on error
```
